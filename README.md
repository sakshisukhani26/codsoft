Codsoft Internship Tasks
This repository contains the tasks I completed during my internship with Codsoft. As part of the program, I successfully tackled three distinct assignments that demonstrate my coding skills and understanding of various concepts.

Tasks Overview
Task 1: Random Number Guessing Game (Java)
In this task, I developed a Java program where:

A random number is generated within a specified range (1-100).
The user is prompted to guess the number, with feedback provided if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
The game continues until the user guesses correctly, with features like limited attempts, multiple rounds, and a scoring system based on attempts.
Task 2: Student Grade Calculator (Java)
For this task, I created a simple student grading system in Java that:

Takes marks obtained (out of 100) in multiple subjects.
Calculates total marks, average percentage, and assigns grades based on the average.
The results display the total marks, average percentage, and the final grade achieved.
Task 3: ATM Simulation System (Java)
In this task, I developed an ATM simulation that:

Allows users to check their account balance, deposit money, and withdraw money.
Includes validation for account balance and appropriate messaging for success or failure.
The ATM is connected to a bank account class, managing the user's balance through deposit and withdrawal methods.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Java
Tools: IDE (IntelliJ IDEA/Eclipse), JDK 8+
